Nowadays, it has become increasingly important for sales companies to go beyond traditional brick-and-mortar stores if they want to remain relevant in the market. Simply relying on in-store sales is no longer sufficient for the vast majority of companies, as the majority of sales now come from the online market. As a result, companies need to explore various approaches to tap into this growing segment. One option for companies is to rely on third- party providers like Amazon to handle their online sales. While this can be a convenient solution, many companies prefer to have their own personal e-commerce platforms. By doing so, they can avoid additional costs associated with using a third-party platform and have more control over their online presence. Having a personal e-commerce platform also allows companies to handle their online operations more easily and freely, adapting to their specific needs and preferences. However, e-commerce is not just a source of sales for companies; it is also a valuable data source. The data generated from e-commerce transactions provides crucial insights that can inform important business decisions. Sales companies understand the significance of data analysis in driving their strategies, and therefore, they are highly interested in individuals who can effectively analyze and interpret sales data.

In line with this, our project will focus on analyzing data from an e-commerce platform specializing in sport articles. By comparing various sectors within this e-commerce, we aim to extract important business information that can guide the company in making informed decisions. By conducting a comprehensive examination of the data, we can uncover patterns, identify potential growth opportunities, optimize pricing strategies, and refine marketing cam- paigns. The insights earned from this analysis will enable sales company in the sport articles sector to stay ahead of the competition, tailor their offerings to customer preferences, and ultimately drive sales growth.
The results obtained from the analysis we conduct will serve as a prototype of the information that the sales department of a company can leverage. Sales managers are particularly inter- ested in earning insights into future expectations and sales data to make informed decisions about implementing promotions. By examining historical data and identifying trends, they can anticipate customer demands and strategically plan promotional campaigns to maximize sales.
Understanding future expectations is crucial for sales managers as it allows them to align their strategies with market trends and customer preferences. By analyzing data from the e-commerce platform, we can identify patterns and forecast potential shifts in demand. This information empowers sales managers to make proactive decisions on product offerings, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns, enabling them to stay ahead of the competition and cater to evolving customer needs.
Additionally, the analysis helps sales managers prepare for future sales by providing valu- able insights into inventory management. By studying sales data, they can determine which products are popular, forecast demand fluctuations, and plan their restocking efforts accord- ingly. This allows them to optimize inventory levels, avoiding stockouts or excess inventory that can negatively impact profitability. The results of our analysis provide sales managers with quantitative information, such as sales trends, product performance, and customer be- havior, enabling them to make data-driven decisions. For example, they can identify the best-selling product categories, evaluate the effectiveness of different marketing campaigns, and assess the impact of pricing strategies on sales performance. Armed with this knowledge, sales managers can allocate resources more effectively, identify areas for improvement, and develop targeted strategies to drive sales growth.

In our project, we have taken the dataset from a prominent sport articles e-commerce site, aiming to conduct a comprehensive analysis and provide valuable insights for the future. The dataset encompasses sales data from 2013 to 2023, capturing information on revenue gen- erated from sales and the corresponding sectors. To facilitate our analysis, we focused on identifying the most performing sector and employed forecasting techniques to predict future trends.
Our approach involved examining the historical sales data for each sector, aiming to under- stand their individual trends and growth patterns, using weather data as exogenous variables. By comparing the future development of these sectors, we aimed to develop sales strategies that would capitalize on those projected to perform well. Simultaneously, we sought to earn insights into specific sectors, discerning whether new emerging sectors were mere fads or had the potential to consistently outperform the established sports market. The main objective of our analysis was to predict future sales for the most performing sectors. By doing so, we aimed to equip businesses with crucial insights that would inform their strategic decision-making for the future. These insights would enable companies to formulate effective sales strategies, al- locate resources efficiently, and adapt their product offerings to align with projected market trends.
In the following section, we will delve into the precise methodology employed to analyze the dataset. We will outline the techniques utilized to identify the most performing sector, discuss the forecasting models employed, and elaborate on the specific steps taken to ensure accurate predictions.
